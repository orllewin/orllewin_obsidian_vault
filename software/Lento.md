## About

A full Android camera app that applies LUTs to photos and also supports de-squeezing images taken with an anamorphic lens. Uses the notoriously awful Android Camera API, not the old bad API, the newer bad API, which has probably now been replaced by an even newer bad AndroidX API. I still use this app all the time it's fantastic. Has interop with [[LUT Film Package]].

## Download

Lento used to be on Google Play, but due to the ridiculous sisyphean task of keeping an app live on there it's probably not now (I started ignoring the automated emails about various tasks that need completing). I'll add an upload here if I remember.

## Status

Archived. Lento 2 is in progress, and has been for years.
