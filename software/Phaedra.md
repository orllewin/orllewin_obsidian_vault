## About

Phaedra was a experimental project to write a [Gemini Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol))client that'd run on the oldest Android devices. It highlights the problems with using TLS in a permacomputing world, crypto suites become compromised and servers stop accepting insecure methods. 

Before the [Conscrypt TLS library](https://github.com/google/conscrypt) was added it was a 55Kb binary, no other dependencies were used, so it was also an experiment in creating an Android app without the modern dependencies we've grown to depend on.
