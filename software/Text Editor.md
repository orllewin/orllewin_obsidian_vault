## Platform

Android.

## About

An Android text editor. I used to work a lot [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/) and using vi/nano etc on a mobile wasn't practical. This project uses [SAF](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider) and allows editing of files in the Termux scope. It's aged better than most of the old projects here and is still useful today.
