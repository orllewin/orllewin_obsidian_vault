## About

A pretty proficient [Gemini Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)) browser for Android. Lagrange took the spotlight but Seren was a more correct Android app with native ui and full accessibility features. A previous open source incarnation was called Ariane. Seren was released under the Anti-capitalist license which annoyed a lot of people.

## Drama

There was some drama around a single line fix someone emailed to me for the first incarnation of this project: Ariane - they said their commit had been scrubbed from the project sometime later, they were very vocal, and it caused a lot of stress and anxiety with people gossiping about it for months in a very nasty manner in Geminispace. There never was a commit, the fix was emailed to me because they didn't want to sign up to Codeberg and in fact it's the last change in the repo the fix actually went into: [codeberg.org/oppenlab/OppenURI](https://codeberg.org/oppenlab/OppenURI). Both OppenURI and the original Ariane project were released under the [EUPL](https://commission.europa.eu/content/european-union-public-licence_en).

## Regarding Geminispace

I've got a huge amount of respect for Solderpunk (the Gemini Protocol creator), but the whole incident made me realise that the project was going in a bad direction. Social networks and bulletin boards were popping up in Geminispace with zero moderation, and lots of passive aggressive 'Regarding Foo Bar, 'In response to Foo Bar', 'In response to the response to my response about Foo Bar', toxic posts started appearing, because it was difficult to create threaded conversations these exchanges were public and telegraphed to the entire space. For what Geminispace was becoming the web had better more mature tooling from a social perspective - not least Mastodon and the Fediverse.
