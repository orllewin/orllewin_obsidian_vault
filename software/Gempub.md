## About

Gempub was a fairly comprehensive attempt at creating a new format for books based on [Gemini's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)) 'Gemtext' markup format (which was a stripped-down Markdown variant), it also acted as a good way of archiving Gemini 'capsules'.

It had some fantastic community contributions, I have no idea if it still has any work ongoing, I left 'Geminispace' a while back after concerns about the lack of safeguards and moderation in the unfolding conventions which turned the protocol into almost a basic social bulletin board.
