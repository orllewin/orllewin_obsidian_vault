## About

This was written to help my daughter at bedtime. It used to work fantastically but Android have changed their permissions model (of course) and the main notification doesn't display, I've not gotten around to updating it yet. All the other noise apps on the Play Store at the time used a pre-recorded audio file, this actually generates noise on the fly and then treats it with a couple of filters to shape the sound.

## Status

Needs runtime permissions adding for the service notification.
