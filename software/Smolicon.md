## About

Smolicon is a nice little 16x16 icon editor for Android. I developed this before taking a role with start-up Yoto which had a 16x16 LED matrix 'screen'. It made use of my own Skiss framework for graphics rendering (the learnings from Skiss (Swedish for 'Sketch') later turned into [Coracle](https://orllewin.github.io/coracle/)).
