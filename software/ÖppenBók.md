## About

An Android eBook reader with a nice 3D page-curl effect. I can't remember how complete this got. As ever with these old projects if you try and build expect the usual Android dependency and file io permission pain. i remember someone from [Merveilles](https://merveilles.town) helped me with the 3D rendering which had a perspective glitch, sorry I can't remember who it was.
