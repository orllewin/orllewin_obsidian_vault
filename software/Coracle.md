## About

Coracle is the name given to a portable Kotlin framework heavily influence by [Processing](https://processing.org/). It's a graphics playground. I spent quite a long time working with it (if not working on it, it was more fun creating the graphics experiments with it than developing it to be robust and correct):

The web is the most polished implementation, but there's an Android version too. At one point there was a desktop JVM version implemented using some other engine but the patterns were too different to make it viable, it would have been better to start from scratch instead of leaning on a 3rd party game engine.
