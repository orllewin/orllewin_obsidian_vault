## About

This was a quickly hacked together Android project to process video that'd been shot using [Moment's Anamorphic lens](https://www.shopmoment.com/products/anamorphic-lens). It's little more than a basic [SAF](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider) file io plus an FFMpeg wrapper library in a service:
