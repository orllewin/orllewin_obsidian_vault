## About

This is/was a standalone app that contained the RawTherapee film simulation LUTs (converted from HaldCLUT to 256x16 format using [[Ã–ppenHald]]). It was a companion app to [[Lento]] and could send LUTs to it, the idea being even though this project [contained lots of brand names and trademarked film names](https://github.com/orllewin/lut_film_simulation_package/tree/main/app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi), Lento itself was trademark free.
