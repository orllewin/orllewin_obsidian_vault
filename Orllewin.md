## Art

Low key creative archive, some made with computers, some by my children.

## Calderdale

Where I live: [[Upper Calder Valley]], Yorkshire.

## Computers

For my sins: [[Computers]]. A place for notes.

## Crafts

More creative work. Strictly no computers.

## Daily Notes

A log. May be empty.

## Hardware

Hardware hacking. Bad soldering.

## Playdate

A cute little yellow console that I enjoy writing software for.

## Software

Broken dreams, a wasteland of half-finished projects.

## Stones

To relax I visit neolithic/megalithic sites: [[Stones]] (all the images were lost in a Obsidian sync disaster)
