## About

MAS is a sample player/live drum machine for [Playdate](https://play.date). Works standalone or with an Android device running the partner app (Note. Android integration makes use of an [undocumented Playdate serial API](https://publish.obsidian.md/orllewin/computers/playdate/Serial+Comms) which Panic could disable at any time).

## Main Controls

When you select a patch from the chooser MAS will be in edit mode, in this mode you use the direction pad to move around the grid, B changes the sample mode (hit/play/loop), A button triggers playback. If you move the crank to the live position all the Playdate buttons become sample triggers if they've been assigned (in the patch JSON) to a sample. It's a difficult feature to describe but intuitive when you're using MAS.

**When using a patch with buttons assigned to trigger samples you move between 'Live' and 'Edit/Manual' mode by moving the crank: 0 - 180 degrees are edit/manual mode, 180 - 360 are live where all 6 input buttons can trigger samples (depending on the patch set-up)**

## Android

Free companion app to trigger samples from a connected Android device:

Android .apk: [musik_aus_sample_0_0_1.apk](https://orllewin.github.io/playdate/musik_aus_sample/android/musik_aus_sample_0_0_1.apk)

# User Patches

Add custom patches to `/Disk/Data/orllewin.playdate.musicaussample/UserPatches`. Custom patches must be in their own directory and include a config.json file.

### Demo User Patches

- [MusicBox.zip](https://orllewin.github.io/playdate/musik_aus_sample/patches/MusicBox.zip)
- [MusicBoxAccompaniment.zip](https://orllewin.github.io/playdate/musik_aus_sample/patches/MusicBoxAccompaniment.zip)

### Make a patch

The patch JSON has a couple of config fields and an array of sample objects, the array size must equal columns x rows.

```

{
  "label": "Default Demo Patch",
  "columns": 4,
  "rows": 2,
  "samples": [
    ...
  ]
}
  
```

#### Sample Object

```

{
  "title": "Kick Drum",
  "path": "/Samples/Kick/Kick 12",
  "type": "sample",
  "mode": "hit",
  "image": "/Images/down",
  "key": "down",
  "volume": 0.75,
  "rate": 1
}
```

- `title`: String. Not truncated so keep it short
- `path`: String, path to the sample, either within the .pda directory or a user patch
- `type`: String: see below. files are streamed from disk. Use sample for anything but long audio files
- `mode`: String, the initial mode, can be one of hit, play, loop - see below for specs for each
- `image`: String optional - path to an image in the .pda directory
- `key`: String optional - one of left, right, up, down, a, b
- `volume`: Float optional - 0.0 to 1.0, default is 1.0
- `rate`: Float optional - playback rate in range 0.0 to 1.0, default is 1.0

#### Type

- `empty`: make the ui cell a spacer/placeholder, can still have text and/or an image
- `sample`: stored in memory so use for drum hits and short loops
- `file`: audio streamed from disk, use for longer files and background music
- `transition`: plays a file while loading in new player, see below

#### Mode

- `play`: plays once, a second tap while playing stops, good for longer samples
- `hit`: plays once, a second tap while playing restarts, good for drum hits
- `loop`: loops forever, a second tap should stop playback

#### Transition

A transition is a special type that allows you to build up a full set with different sample sets/patches. When triggered an optional sample can be played once while the ui for the new patch is loaded, any other playing samples are stopped immediately, mode is ignored for this type.

```

{
  "title": "GOTO SET2",
  "path": "/UserPatches/set1/interlude",
  "type": "transition",
  "image": "/UserPatch/set1/transition_image",
  "next": "/UserPatches/set2/"
}
```

#### Wav Conversion

Audio needs to be converted to Playdates own .pda format before you can use it in custom patches:

- First prepare your samples in [ADPCM .wav format](https://sdk.play.date/1.13.7/Inside%20Playdate.html#M-sound-prep)
- [Install the Playdate SDK](https://play.date/dev/), you'll need to use the pdc command-line Playdate compiler that comes with it
- Add the pdc compiler to your path
- Put your ADPCM .wav files in a directory together with an empty file named `main.lua`
- Compile the fake Playdate game: `pdc MySampleSet/`
- This will create `MySampleSet.pdx` which although a compiled Playdate game is just a directory. View the contents (MACOS: right click then: 'Show Package Contents') and move the newly converted .pda files to your patch directory

# USB

MAS can be controlled by an Android device connected via USB running [musik_aus_sample_0_0_1.apk](https://orllewin.github.io/playdate/musik_aus_sample/android/musik_aus_sample_0_0_1.apk). This is an experimental feature and could break if Panic turn off the USB serial `eval` method in a future Playdate OS release.

# Built-in samples

#### Image Attribution

Most of the images have been removed but some of the following remain, all from [thenounproject.com/coquet_adrien/](https://thenounproject.com/coquet_adrien/):

`jellyfish.png, frequency.png, sine.png, rain_cloud.png, snow_cloud.png, censored.png, heartbeat.png, bomb.png, recycle.png, octopus.png, snail.png, happy_jellyfish1.png, happy_jellyfish2.png, coronavirus.png, joking.png, tease.png, laugh.png, concentrate.png, pirate.png, grasshopper.png, creature.png`

#### Sample Attribution

The vast majority of audio samples come from MusicRadar: [musicradar.com/news/tech/free-music-samples-royalty-free-loops-hits-and-multis-to-download](https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/free-music-samples-royalty-free-loops-hits-and-multis-to-download)

#### Full list of built-in samples

You can user these in your patches or convert your own wavs and add them to a patch directory.
