We live in a small hamlet called Sourhall which is in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. Our house is a small terrace in what used to be a mill, and then a [smallpox isolation hospital](https://sites.rootsweb.com/~todmordenandwalsden/sourhallhospital.htm), before being converted to 6 houses in the late 1970s

The old hospital whitewash (see below) is still visible on the attic beams today:
